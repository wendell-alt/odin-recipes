    <h3>Arroz caldo is a comforting and flavorsome Filipino rice and chicken soup served mainly as a snack but can be enjoyed any time of the day.</h3>
    <p> Arroz caldo is a lugaw (glutinous rice dish) made with chicken and rice. It’s flavored with garlic, onions, ginger, fish sauce, and other seasonings.</p>
    <p>Though “arroz caldo” is a Spanish name, the dish’s origins are Filipino — it is an adaptation of a congee that was created by Chinese-Filipino immigrants.  </p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 (2 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 ¼ pounds chicken wings, split and tips discarded</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce <em>(Optional)</em></li>
        <li>5 ¼ cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 cup glutinous sweet rice</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 green onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 lemon, sliced <em>(Optional)</em></li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fish sauce for sprinkling, if desired <em>(Optional)</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion, garlic, and ginger in hot oil until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add chicken wings; cook and stir for 1 minute. Stir in fish sauce, cover, and cook another 2 minutes. </li>
        <li>Pour chicken broth into the pot. Stir in sweet rice and bring mixture to a boil. Cover and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent rice from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Season with salt and pepper. </li>
        <li>Portion soup into bowls and garnish with green onion. Serve with lemon slices and additional fish sauce, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
